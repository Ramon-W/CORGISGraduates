    <h2 class="marginL">Overview</h2>
    <p class="marginL">The Graduates dataset¹ is based off of the National Survey of Recent College Graduates². The dataset includes multiple surveys, each in a different year. The time gap between surveys are not constant, but is generally around 2-3 years. It only surveys those who have graduated with their degree in at least the last 2 academic years, those who are under 73 years old, and only those that are graduates of a U.S. academic institution. It sorts the data by year, and then by major. This dataset is especially useful to determine trends in education, employment opportunities, and salaries of graduate students.</p>
    <h2 class="marginL">Commonly Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul class="marginL">
      <li><span class="italic">Why are Asians seperated from other minorities in this dataset?</span> Generally, Asians outnumber the combined total of other minority groups in each major, so seperating them would result in more useful data.</li>
      <li><span class="italic">What is the difference between “Not in the Labor Force” and “Unemployed”?</span> According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics³, “Unemployed” is meant for people who are still looking for jobs while "Not in the Labor Force" relates to people who are neither in a job nor looking for one.</li>
      <li><span class="italic">Why are there only 0.0s for the data in some majors?</span> If a major (in a certain year) has only 0.0s, it means the major had not existed yet in that year.</li>
    </ul>
